# Progect Synopsis
These are the results of my involvement in a research project with [Dr. Thomas Humphries](https://www.uwb.edu/engineering-math/faculty/mathematics/thumphries) at UW Bothell. We were researching improvements to the iterative algorithm [SART](https://engineering.purdue.edu/RVL/Publications/SART_84.pdf) for reconstructing low-dose CT images. Our experiments revolved around utilizing a non-differentiable function ([BM3D](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/BM3D_TIP_2007.pdf)) to generate perturbations for the superiorization of SART. More thorough background can be found in the accompanying paper, [BM3D as a Superiorization Function Within Sart for Denoising of Computed Tomography Images](https://github.com/j-henshaw/SART_pnp_BM3D_new/blob/main/Paper/Henshaw%2C%20Jon%20-%20BM3D%20as%20a%20Superiorization%20Function%20Within%20Sart%20for%20Denoising%20of%20Computed%20Tomography%20Images%2C%20UW%20Bothell%2C%202022.pdf) (embedded below). The .tex file is also available for inspection [here](https://github.com/j-henshaw/SART_pnp_BM3D_new/blob/main/Paper/Henshaw%2C%20Jon%20-%20BM3D%20as%20a%20Superiorization%20Function%20Within%20Sart%20for%20Denoising%20of%20Computed%20Tomography%20Images%2C%20UW%20Bothell%2C%202022.tex). Also included in this branch is a .yml file which should be capable of setting-up a conda environment suitable for running the software. However, some of the requirements in the .yml file may be hardware-dependent. For comparison with preexisting work, please see the [original branch](https://github.com/TDHumphries/SART-ASTRA) of this project, from Dr. Humphries.
